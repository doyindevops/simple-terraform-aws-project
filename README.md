SIMPLE-TERRAFORM-AWS-PROJECT

This is me trying to master how to  Provision a three-tier cloud architecture with Terraform on AWS in the following steps.

Step 1: Set up an AWS account If you haven't already, create an AWS account and configure your access keys. These keys will allow Terraform to communicate with your AWS account.

Step 2: Install Terraform Download and install Terraform on your local machine. Terraform is a command-line tool that you use to define and provision infrastructure.

Step 3: Write the Terraform code Create a new directory for your Terraform code and create a file called main.tf. In this file, you'll define the AWS resources you want to provision.

This code defines a VPC, three subnets in different availability zones, an internet gateway, a route table, and route table associations for each subnet.

Step 4: Initialize Terraform Run terraform init in the directory where you created main.tf. This will download the necessary plugins and set up the Terraform backend.

Step 5: Plan the infrastructure Run terraform plan to see what infrastructure Terraform will create. This step is optional but recommended as it allows


After running the terraform plan command and reviewing the output, you should make sure that the plan looks correct and meets your requirements.

If you are satisfied with the plan, you can apply it to create the infrastructure by running the terraform apply command. Terraform will show you a summary of the changes that it will make to your infrastructure and prompt you to confirm the changes before proceeding.

Once you confirm, Terraform will create the resources and configure them according to your code. If any errors occur during the apply process, Terraform will notify you and show you the errors that need to be corrected.

It is a good practice to regularly backup your infrastructure code and keep it in version control so that you can easily roll back or make changes to your infrastructure in the future.
